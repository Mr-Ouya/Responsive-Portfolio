      <img src="assets/Nick.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I was born in Mississauga Ontario but was raised in Brampton. I grew up on baseball and videogames. </p>

      <p>I have 2 children a wife and a chihuahua. We are a very tight family and are close with a lot of extended family.</p>

      <p>I went to school for Social Work and spent 10 years working in the field. Although very rewarding it was time for a new challenge.</p>
